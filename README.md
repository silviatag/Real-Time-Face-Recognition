# Real-Time-Face-Recognition
This is a Python program that uses the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection and recognition. The program can detect faces in a video stream and recognize them by comparing them against a database of known faces.

Once the program is running, it will use your system's default camera to capture a video stream. As faces are detected in the stream, they will be compared against the known faces in the database. If a match is found, the person's name will be displayed on the screen.

The program will use the images in the database to learn how to recognize faces. To add new faces to the database, you can create a new directory containing images of the person you want to add, with each image named after the person's name. Then, you can re-run the program to update the database.
